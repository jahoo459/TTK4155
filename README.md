# TTK4155
Industrial and Embedded Computer Systems Design Term Project

This is a software for our TTK4155 project - Ping Pong Machine. 

The project consists of 2 nodes. Each node is running on separate microcontroller. CAN bus is used for communication between them.

Parts of the project:

Part 1 - Initial assembly of microcontroller and RS-232
Part 2 - Address decoding and external RAM
Part 3 - A/D converting and joystick input
Part 4 - OLED display and user interface
Part 5 - SPI and CAN controller
Part 6 - CAN-bus and communication between nodes
Part 7 - Controlling servo and IR
Part 8 - Controlling motor and solenoid
Part 9 - Completion of the project and extras
